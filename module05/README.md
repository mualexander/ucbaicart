[Jupyter notebook for assignment 5.1](./assignment5_1/prompt.jpynb)

### Summary of Findings

Coupon usage is very dependent on time of day, who one is travelling with, and if the coupon was for a type of establishment that one has a history of visiting.

In order to maximize adoption of coupons, an attempt could be made to:
1. Show coffee coupons until the early afternoon
2. Show inexpensive restaurant coupons from the mid morning through the evening.
3. Show take out coupons from the morning through the end of the day.
4. Show coupons for more expensive restaurants to people who are travelling with their partners.
5. Show bar coupons to those who have shown that they go to bars and are not travelling with kids.
6. If a user is travelling with kids, focus on showing them carryout and inexpensive food coupons throughout the day and coffee until the mid-afternoon.
